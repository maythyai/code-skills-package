description: Multi-agent orchestration using dmux (tmux pane manager for AI agents). Patterns for parallel agent workflows across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and other harnesses. Use when running multiple agent sessions in parallel or coordinating multi-agent development workflows.
layer: 4
category: patterns

| Tool | Role | Strength |
|------|------|----------|
| **dmux** | tmux pane management for agents | Parallel agent sessions |
| **Superset** | Terminal IDE for 10+ parallel agents | Large-scale orchestration |
| **Claude Code Task tool** | In-process subagent spawning | Programmatic parallelism within a session |
| **Codex multi-agent** | Built-in agent roles | Codex-specific parallel work |

## Troubleshooting

- **Pane not responding:** Check if the agent session is waiting for input. Use `m` to read output.
- **Merge conflicts:** Use git worktrees to isolate file changes per pane.
- **High token usage:** Reduce number of parallel panes. Each pane is a full agent session.
- **tmux not found:** Install with `brew install tmux` (macOS) or `apt install tmux` (Linux).
