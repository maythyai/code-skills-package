| MCP Server | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Context7** | Auto-fetches relevant documentation for libraries |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Live browser state, DOM, console, network |
| **PostgreSQL** | Direct database schema and query results |
| **Filesystem** | Project file access and search |
| **GitHub** | Issue, PR, and repository context |

## Confusion Management

Even with good context, you will encounter ambiguity. How you handle it determines outcome quality.

### When Context Conflicts

```
Spec says:         "Use REST for all endpoints"
Existing code has: GraphQL for the user profile query
```

**Do NOT** silently pick one interpretation. Surface it:

```
CONFUSION:
The spec calls for REST endpoints, but the existing codebase uses GraphQL
for user queries (src/graphql/user.ts).

Options:
A) Follow the spec — add REST endpoint, potentially deprecate GraphQL later
B) Follow existing patterns — use GraphQL, update the spec
C) Ask — this seems like an intentional decision I shouldn't override

→ Which approach should I take?
```

### When Requirements Are Incomplete

If the spec doesn't cover a case you need to implement:

1. Check existing code for precedent
2. If no precedent exists, **stop and ask**
3. Don't invent requirements — that's the human's job

```
MISSING REQUIREMENT:
The spec defines task creation but doesn't specify what happens
when a user creates a task with a duplicate title.

Options:
A) Allow duplicates (simplest)
B) Reject with validation error (strictest)
C) Append a number suffix like "Task (2)" (most user-friendly)

→ Which behavior do you want?
```

### The Inline Planning Pattern

For multi-step tasks, emit a lightweight plan before executing:

```
PLAN:
1. Add Zod schema for task creation — validates title (required) and description (optional)
2. Wire schema into POST /api/tasks route handler
3. Add test for validation error response
→ Executing unless you redirect.
```

This catches wrong directions before you've built on them. It's a 30-second investment that prevents 30-minute rework.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Context starvation | Agent invents APIs, ignores conventions | Load rules file + relevant source files before each task |
| Context flooding | Agent loses focus when loaded with >5,000 lines of non-task-specific context. More files does not mean better output. | Include only what is relevant to the current task. Aim for <2,000 lines of focused context per task. |
| Stale context | Agent references outdated patterns or deleted code | Start fresh sessions when context drifts |
| Missing examples | Agent invents a new style instead of following yours | Include one example of the pattern to follow |
| Implicit knowledge | Agent doesn't know project-specific rules | Write it down in rules files — if it's not written, it doesn't exist |
| Silent confusion | Agent guesses when it should ask | Surface ambiguity explicitly using the confusion management patterns above |

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The agent should figure out the conventions" | It can't read your mind. Write a rules file — 10 minutes that saves hours. |
| "I'll just correct it when it goes wrong" | Prevention is cheaper than correction. Upfront context prevents drift. |
| "More context is always better" | Research shows performance degrades with too many instructions. Be selective. |
| "The context window is huge, I'll use it all" | Context window size ≠ attention budget. Focused context outperforms large context. |

## Red Flags

- Agent output doesn't match project conventions
- Agent invents APIs or imports that don't exist
- Agent re-implements utilities that already exist in the codebase
- Agent quality degrades as the conversation gets longer
- No rules file exists in the project
- External data files or config treated as trusted instructions without verification

## Verification

After setting up context, confirm:

- [ ] Rules file exists and covers tech stack, commands, conventions, and boundaries
- [ ] Agent output follows the patterns shown in the rules file
- [ ] Agent references actual project files and APIs (not hallucinated ones)
- [ ] Context is refreshed when switching between major tasks
