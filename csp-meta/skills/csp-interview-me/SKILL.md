name: csp-interview-me
description: Extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want. Achieves this through one-question-at-a-time interview until ~95% confidence about the underlying intent. Use when an ask is underspecified ("build me X" without "for whom" or "why now"), when the user explicitly invokes ("interview me", "grill me", "are we sure?", "stress-test my thinking"), or when you catch yourself silently filling in ambiguous requirements before any plan, spec, or code exists.

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "The ask is clear enough" | If you can't write the user's desired outcome in one sentence right now, the ask isn't clear. Run Step 1 before deciding. |
| "Asking too many questions wastes their time" | Time wasted by 4–6 targeted questions is small. Time wasted by building the wrong thing is enormous, and the user is the one bearing that cost. |
| "I'll figure it out as I build" | Switching costs after code exists are 10x what they are now. Discovery during implementation is rework. |
| "They said 'whatever you think,' so I should just decide" | "Whatever you think" is delegation, not decision. Re-ask with two concrete options as a choice. |
| "I should give them several options to pick from" | Options work when the user knows what they want and is choosing between trade-offs. They don't know what they want yet. Listing options widens the search; asking narrows it. |
| "If I attach my guess, I'm leading them" | Leading is the point. Reacting is faster than generating from scratch. The risk is sycophancy, not leading; mitigate by being visibly willing to be wrong. |
| "We've talked enough, I get it" | Test it: can you predict their reaction to the next three questions? If not, you don't get it yet. |
| "The user said yes, we're done" | If the yes followed a vague restate or an open-ended "sounds good," the yes is hollow. Restate concretely and re-confirm. |

## Red Flags

- Three or more questions in a single message: that's batching, not interviewing
- A question without your hypothesis attached: that's surveying, not committing
- Accepting "whatever you think is best" as a terminal answer
- Producing a spec, plan, or task list before the user has explicitly confirmed your restate
- Questions framed as "what would be best practice?" instead of "what do you actually want?"
- The user gives a sophistication-signaling answer ("scalable", "clean", "modern") and you accept it without probing whether it's what they actually want
- Three or more rounds without your confidence visibly rising: you're asking the wrong questions, step back and reframe
- A confidence number below ~70% with no reason attached: the user can't help close the gap if they don't know what's missing
- Saving the intent doc before the user has confirmed (the doc itself implies a yes the user didn't give)
- Skipping the "Out of scope" line in the restate (silent disagreement about non-goals is half of misalignment)

## Verification

After applying interview-me:

- [ ] An explicit hypothesis with a confidence number was stated in the first turn
- [ ] Every confidence number below ~70% was accompanied by a one-line reason (what's still unresolved or missing)
- [ ] Questions were asked one at a time, each with the agent's guess attached
- [ ] At least one "what would you actually want if you didn't have to justify it?" probe ran when the user gave a sophistication-signaling or convention-signaling answer
- [ ] A concrete restate (Outcome / User / Why now / Success / Constraint / Out of scope) was written back to the user
- [ ] The user confirmed the restate with an explicit yes (not "whatever you think," not "sounds good," not silence)
- [ ] At the stop point, the agent could predict reactions to the next three questions it would ask
- [ ] Any handoff to a downstream skill (`csp-idea-refine`, `csp-spec-driven-development`) was framed in terms of the confirmed intent, not the original underspecified ask
