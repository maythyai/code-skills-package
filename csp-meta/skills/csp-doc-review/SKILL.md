| Placeholder | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| `{persona_file}` | Full content of the agent's markdown file |
| `{schema}` | Content of the findings schema included below |
| `{document_type}` | "requirements" or "plan" from Phase 1 classification |
| `{document_path}` | Path to the document |
| `{origin_path}` | Value of the document's `origin:` frontmatter field if present, or the literal string `none` if absent. Personas that adapt on origin (product-lens, adversarial, scope-guardian) read this slot to gate technique suppression — they do NOT re-parse frontmatter themselves. Extract this once during Phase 1 reading. |
| `{document_content}` | Full text of the document |
| `{decision_primer}` | Cumulative prior-round decisions in the current session, or an empty `<prior-decisions>` block on round 1. See "Decision primer" below. |

Pass each agent the **full document** — do not split into sections.

### Decision primer

On round 1 (no prior decisions), set `{decision_primer}` to:

```
<prior-decisions>
Round 1 — no prior decisions.
</prior-decisions>
```

On round 2+ (after one or more prior rounds in the current interactive session), accumulate prior-round decisions and render them as:

```
<prior-decisions>
Round 1 — applied (N entries):
- {section}: "{title}" ({reviewer}, {confidence})
  Evidence: "{evidence_snippet}"

Round 1 — rejected (M entries):
- {section}: "{title}" — Skipped because {reason}
  Evidence: "{evidence_snippet}"
- {section}: "{title}" — Deferred to Open Questions because {reason or "no reason provided"}
  Evidence: "{evidence_snippet}"
- {section}: "{title}" — Acknowledged without applying because {reason or "no suggested_fix — user acknowledged"}
  Evidence: "{evidence_snippet}"

Round 2 — applied (N entries):
...
</prior-decisions>
```

Each entry carries an `Evidence:` line because synthesis R29 (rejected-finding suppression) and R30 (fix-landed verification) both use an evidence-substring overlap check as part of their matching predicate — without the evidence snippet in the primer, the orchestrator cannot compute the `>50%` overlap test and has to fall back to fingerprint-only matching, which either re-surfaces rejected findings or suppresses too aggressively. The `{evidence_snippet}` is the first evidence quote from the finding, truncated to the first ~120 characters (preserving whole words at the boundary) and with internal quotes escaped. If a finding has multiple evidence entries, use the first one; the rest live in the run artifact and are not needed for the overlap check.

Accumulate across all rounds in the current session. Skip, Defer, and Acknowledge actions all count as "rejected" for suppression purposes — each signals the user decided the finding wasn't worth actioning this round (Acknowledge is the no-fix-guard variant: the user saw a finding with no `suggested_fix`, chose not to defer or skip explicitly, and recorded acknowledgement instead; for round-to-round suppression that is semantically equivalent to Skip). Applied findings stay on the applied list so round-N+1 personas can verify fixes landed (see R30 in `references/synthesis-and-presentation.md`).

Cross-session persistence is out of scope. A new invocation of csp-doc-review on the same document starts with a fresh round 1 and no carried primer, even if prior sessions deferred findings into the document's Open Questions section.

**Error handling:** If an agent fails or times out, proceed with findings from agents that completed. Note the failed agent in the Coverage section. Do not block the entire review on a single agent failure.

**Dispatch limit:** Even at maximum (7 agents), use bounded parallel dispatch. If the harness cap is lower than the selected team size, queue the remainder and launch them as active reviewers complete.

## Phases 3-5: Synthesis, Presentation, and Next Action

After all dispatched agents return, read `references/synthesis-and-presentation.md` for the synthesis pipeline (validate, anchor-based gate, dedup, cross-persona agreement promotion, resolve contradictions, auto-promotion, route by three tiers with FYI subsection), `safe_auto` fix application, headless-envelope output, and the handoff to the routing question.

For the four-option routing question and per-finding walk-through (interactive mode), read `references/walkthrough.md`. For the bulk-action preview used by best-judgment routing, Append-to-Open-Questions, and walk-through `Auto-resolve with best judgment on the rest`, read `references/bulk-preview.md`. Do not load these files before agent dispatch completes.
